                            The IT industry is a large and dynamic industry that is constantly changing with time. It is important
for us to gain an idea about the day-to-day life of being in the IT industry and what this industry
demands from professionals involved in this dynamic environment. As it can be hard to get an
accurate impression of the industry through secondary sources, we decided to directly speak to an
experienced IT professional who is actively involved in the IT industry here in Melbourne, Australia.
This IT professional is a Software Engineer in a major financial institution in Australia.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our preferred method to do this was through a face to face or an online video interview. However,
as the chosen individual was in a dynamic and busy industry such as the IT industry, this method was
not possible. At the request of the interviewee, we decided to do an interview through email
communication, as this allowed the interviewee to respond at a time that was convenient to him.

                            Recently I was involved with re designing of front facing application and it was a
tremendous effort done by our team to deliver a better customer experience. This
lead to reduce number of enquiries and customer were able to proceed with the flow
successfully without confusion.

                <div class="row">
                    
                    <div class="col-md-12 title">
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The responses from the interviewee were simpler than what we would have preferred, however,
considering the busy schedule of an IT professional, these responses were highly appreciated by the
whole team. We believe that they are adequate though to get an idea about working in the industry.
            <br /><br />
                            A main takeaway from the interview is that working in the IT industry means that you are not just
involved in one job or task. You become involved in a broad range of tasks. Some that may require
you to be on call 24 hours a day. You may also be involved in other tasks such as the recruitment
process or mentoring of junior developers.
            <br /><br />
                            Another noticeable takeaway from the interview responses is that since the industry is a highly
dynamic and constantly changing industry, it is important that an IT professional stays up to date
with any technological advancements. As the interviewee has mentioned in his responses above, he
attends technology meetups and conferences to update himself with the latest technological
advancements in the industry and keeps up to date with new programming languages and
techniques through the use of self-development methodologies.
            <br /><br />
                            The interviewee said that his daily interactions were mainly with his team members of various
positions such as developers, testers, technical leads and scrum masters and colleagues from outside
his team such as front facing staff and leadership managers. His interactions with other IT
professionals were through meetups and conferences, that are now mainly digital meetups with 
developers across the world. The interviewee does not directly interact with clients or investors,
however, has stressed that he works on the features and development that directly impact the
company’s growth where the clients and investors are benefitted.
            <br /><br />
                            The interviewee responded that most of his time is spent on implementing solutions to a given
technical or non-technical problem. He also said that he spends a lot of time of communicating with
his other team members on technical requirements, while providing advice on them. The most
challenging aspect of his work is seen to be getting the correct business requirements from the start
itself. This is apparently due to the changing business requirements that in turn change the scope of
work. This in turn changes the delivery.
            <br /><br />
                            The interviewees response to my final question, depicts the quality and the importance of the IT
industry in this highly technological age. He has said that he was recently involved in the redesigning
of a front facing application that the team put a tremendous effort on to enhance the customer
experience. This redesign had reduced the number of enquiries and the customers were able to
proceed with the workflow without any confusion. The impact of this redesigning on the customer
experience and the resulting reduction of enquiries, shows how important this IT industry is in this
age.
