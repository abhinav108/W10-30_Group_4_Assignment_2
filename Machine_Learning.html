                            Machine learning (ML) is a form of AI involving the use of data to learn and predict outcomes. It uses algorithms that require input data to find patterns and generate an output with minimal human interference. It can be categorized into two fields: Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning. Supervised machine learning builds a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. It uses labeled data as a training set, which includes inputs and their corresponding/correct outputs, to create a model. This model is tested against a success or fail rate to further refine it. Supervised machine learning problems can be categorized into two types: regression and classification. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            Regression is used to understand the relationship between an independent and dependent variable. It is used to make predictions based on the association of two variables. Regression algorithms are used to make prediction based on historical patterns, for e.g., day-to-day stock trading. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            Classification is used to group data into specific categories. It attempts to classify the data by assigning class labels to data from a database (Brownlee, 2020).  
                            <br />
                            For example, sorting mail to classify spam or not spam. 
 <br />
                            <br />

                            Machine learning was born out of a need to automate simple and redundant tasks. Early examples of machine learning were used to automate basic tasks like mathematical modelling. Modern uses of machine learning includes the use of neural networks to mimic human behavior and optimization of data-processing applications. Data intensive fields such as astronomy, biology, climatology, medicine, finance, and economy have benefitted from machine learnings’ ability to process information rich datasets (Al-Jarrah et al. 2015). 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            In the medical field machine learning allows medical experts to use biomarkers and other genetic risk factors to train regression algorithms to reliably predict risk of any conditions (Steyerberg, van der Ploeg & Van Calster 2014). It has also been used in material science to model physical property of certain sophisticated materials (Schmidt et al. 2019). However recent advancements in ML algorithms and increase in trading volume has made machine learning a focal point in the financial sector. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Machine learning algorithms can also be used to strengthen security of financial institutions. Commercial banks have to monitor thousands of transactions every day to reduce the risk of fraud. It would be very costly for a bank to manually verify each transaction and detect any fraud. Classification algorithms are trained using existing transaction in order to verify and detect any potentially fraudulent activity. If the algorithm detects suspicious behavior it can request for additional identification from the user or block the transaction altogether. Banks benefit from having stronger security while also not having to hire employees that manually verify and detect fraud. More sophisticated classification algorithms can also be trained to help forensic accountants identify any large scale scam or money laundering techniques. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Machine learning algorithms have also allowed for process automation which enables you to increase productivity by replacing manual work and automate repetitive tasks. Businesses now have employed chatbots that use machine learning to answer questions in order to increase customer satisfaction. Call-centers are automated through machine learning to improve efficiency and provide customers a way to self-service. This automation increases efficiency and decreases cost for the business.  
 <br />
                            <br />
                            With the emergence of new technologies and unprecedented dependence on the internet, it is predicted that there will be as much data created as was created in the entire history of planet Earth. Everyday 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is produced by humans every day (Bulao, 2021). This abundance of data has brought the world into the era of Big Data and with it the need to analyze this data effectively and efficiently has increased. Data is constantly being created from video cameras, smart phones, credit cards, and other tech devices. The ability to analyse this data and extract insights on the behavior, personality and/or life events will allow business to leverage these insights to generate better products, employ better business strategies and market their products towards their target customers. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            Current data modelling techniques are too slow for the volume that is being created, and therefore it would require an immense amount of computational power to efficiently analyse. There is a greater need to develop better machine learning algorithms to meet future demands. This increasing demand has spurred on the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANNs work similar to the human brain, a host of algorithms are paired together in a network to generate an output, like neurons in a brain, hence the name Artificial Neural Networks. The algorithms are ‘usually represented as artificial nodes or “neurons” in different layers connected together by synapse’ (Learn Neural Networks 2020, para. 4). The foremost issue with Big Data analytics is the enormous amount of unsupervised data. In order to extract complex patterns from this massive volume of data we require a system that is able to perform tasks like data tagging, semantic indexing, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks like classification and regression. ANNs, unlike other ML techniques, ‘exploit the availability of massive amounts of data where algorithms with shallow learning hierarchies fail to explore and understand the higher complexities of data patterns’.  (Najafabadi et al. 2015).

                            <br />
                            Machine learning has made automation of repetitive tasks possible. It has shown to improve quality of life by reducing repetitive tasks and increasing efficiency. It has also reduced costs for businesses and improved customer service. The most recent innovations in machine learning have shown the potential to effectively analyse and extract meaningful insights from unlabeled, uncategorized raw data; an ability coveted in the era of big data. Moving forward machine learning is likely to improve efficiency due to its ability to perform automate tasks at a large scale. It has also fundamentally changed the way any form of data is analyzed. Many new technologies like self-driving cars, automated call centers, face and voice recognition, etc. benefit from ML algorithms. Not only is machine learning useful for quality of life purposes it is also the avenue of innovation in this age of new technologies.
