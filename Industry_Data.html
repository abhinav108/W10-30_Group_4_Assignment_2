                            However, the Burning Glass report regarding IT industry, published in 2020, suggested slight differences to the ideal job section. The following is the job titles in the ideal job section, ranked with the Burning Glass Skills of Mass Disruption report, which is specifically targeted to IT industry (disclaimer: may not be 100% correct):

                            In an another Burning Glass-BCG report, it ranked the following general work skills preferred or prioritised by prospective employers. Only skills that are most relevant to the ideal job list section above are listed here:  

 <br />
                            <br />

                            Microsoft office (2)
                            <br />

                            General administrative skills (5)
                            <br />

                            Project managements (6)
                            <br />

                            Budget management (7)
                            <br />

                            In this report, it is surprising to see that Microsoft Office is no longer considered an IT skill, given the general workforce across any industries would require such skills for their job, but also employers are now increasingly seeking those who possess multiple job skills rather than candidates that only has limited number of perfected skills. Also, administration is a relatively new addition to this list, and has already reached near-top place in the general skills list. This development is mostly because of the line between employees and supervisors, or managers has been more blurred than ever before, especially over the quarantine work from home periods.

                            1. General adaptability with various technologies 
                            <br />
                            2. Python 
                            <br />
                            3. IT security advice 
                            <br />
                            4. Visual design 
                            <br />
                            5. Multitasking 
                            <br />
                            6. Database management

                            After reading this report, there has been updates to perceptions on most sought-after jobs from employers. Though the position of chief information officer is important, it is not the priority for many employers despite growing need to manage whole-of-company technologies. While at the same time, mobile software development, whether for utilities or gaming, has gained momentum as demands for new, especially revolutionary applications from billions of mobile phone users around the world continues to grow.

                            Even though there are some changes to my perception about jobs and skills, it has not significantly changed. The [2] skills report dates to 2019, which has a labour market significantly different to the post-coronavirus job market in 2021. The new workplace normal has replaced offices (spates of in-person office closures, more cost saving measures, etc.), as well as business travel (where international meetings replaced with video conferencing) with remote work and meetings, while technologies required to build up for the new workplace normal has largely matured over the past year. Therefore, the data presented in [2] may be irrelevant as of today.
