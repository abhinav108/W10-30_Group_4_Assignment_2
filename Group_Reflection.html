                            I enjoyed working as part of a team and have gained valuable experience in the process. We delegated roles and responsibilities to each member as a group, allowing everyone to work equally. Collaborative skills have improved as a result of working in groups. Working in a group gave me different perspectives and allowed me to tackle more complex problems than I could alone. We held regular meetings (2 formal meetups with all members and 3-4 informal meetups while working on the project) and used to prepare meeting agendas and minutes, which helped me learn how to plan ahead and manage my time effectively.
                              <br />
                            Our group had seven members, all of whom I found to be extremely supportive, which surprised me. We all have different time zones, which made it difficult for us to communicate at times. As a result, we devised a common time when everyone is off work. I took on the task of creating the group's website and expanded on the project idea. Along the way, I also picked up a new skill i.e. creating a 3D model to represent our concept. For meetings, announcements, and discussions, we used Microsoft Teams and Canvas, Google Docs for sharing our work, and github for sharing the group website.

                            Our group turned out be a very balanced group. In my opinion, the members of the group were hard working, smart and understanding of the different situations the other members of the group were facing in their real life. The effects of COVID-19 meant that some members of our group did the assignment from overseas. Thus, our meetings were limited strictly to video or audio meetings. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our initial plan was to conduct at the least two formal and pre-planned meetings each week. However, this turned out to be difficult due the busy work lives of our group members and due to current COVID crisis going on in India, where two of our members are based. Though we only managed to have four formal recorded meetings, we did have numerous informal meetings that were highly productive and contributed positively towards the assignment. Instead of every one working on each task, we delegated the tasks according to the strengths of each member. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our busy work lives also meant that sometimes we were not able to achieve our targets in terms of on time performance. We also had one of our original members drop from the subject with only two days left for the due date. This had consequences on the team with added pressure and the task of completing his section. Despite all these, I believe the team did great job together.

                            In Assignment 2 I think I performed very good. As this is a group assignment we divided our tasks between members and whatever tasks I got completed by the time as good as I could. In the group meetings we always setted up our agendas for the whole week. We had our meetings twice in a week with a duration of 20-30 minutes. Initially we had some communication issues but by the time everything gets fixed. The first and foremost thing that i learnt from the group is how to work in a team, how to collaborate different ideas from different members in an one great idea. Aside from that, the members were the one aspect of the group that I found surprising. There were seven people in the group, which gave us a lot of different viewpoints on how to tackle issues. When working in a team, the most valuable lesson was how to organise and arrange my time for various tasks and meetings. When I'm in a group, I improve my communication skills by sharing my suggestions with the other members. In addition, I picked up some new skills from the other members of the group, such as how to write a good report. The burden of assignment 2 is also mitigated by remaining in the team. In comparison to group assignments, individual assignments place all of the task burden on a single person, whereas group assignments split the workload.

                            Working with the Food Tunnelz group was an interesting experience. Due to the coronavirus pandemic a couple of our group mates were not in Melbourne. Working on this project was an interesting experience as this was my first time working in a group with international members. We initially had issues setting up a meeting time, however once the project was on the way meeting times were mostly respected by all members of the group. Although I missed a couple of meetings, my group members were always understanding and willing to help me catch up. However sometimes, due to inherit problems with the chosen communication platform (MS Teams), unplanned communication was difficult. Due to the assignment requirements, it is not possible to move all communication to another platform, however it might be beneficial to move informal communication to a more suited platform. Towards the end of the assignment one of our group members left and some contributions from members were unsatisfactory. This left us with more work than expected. A lesson learned from these unfortunate circumstances would be to discuss potential problems beforehand, either through a group charter or an informal discussion, so that the course of action is laid out instead of last-minute discussions. Such obstacles have highlighted the importance of creating group charters in future group work.

                            I believe that our group performed outstanding in completing tasks to the best of their ability which was achieved by dividing the group work evenly to each member of the team at start of the assignment so that every member of our group can have fair amount of contribution/equal opportunity in group and to do group work. Which potentially led us to submit the assignment in the highest standard.  
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            But something that I believe our group can improve upon in future assignments is that attending more group meeting and communication more often with teammates if they are facing any issues with their part of assignment. If this part can be improved our group will be able to perform much better than we have now. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            However, our group also was unable to submit the assignment on time with no fault of our group because our group found out only 2 days before submitting the assignment that one member of our group left the course which caused us to redo their work and also led us into an extra day of work for all group members as every member had to do some extra amount of work. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Overall, I believe that every member of our group was able to complete their work at their highest standards and some members even completed extra work which they weren’t supposed to do and helped other members of group who struggled with some parts of their assignment which helped us all to improve and make this assignment as good as possible.

                            In this group, every group member has delivered a thorough, insightful information for their assigned sections. I have collected, categorised, and then analysed the ideal job that our team members desire to enter in the future, and skills required. For example, based on the data available, no one has predicted such rapid rise in automation and artificial intelligence, and the disruptions it had brought to the society.  
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Throughout the meetings, there has been many great ideas being discussed among members, some of them closely aligned with the evolving world, others more of imagination, but any ideas that contains both helps the group go further, especially regarding the ultra-futuristic and imaginative project idea, the pod restaurant, being proposed by one of our group members.  
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            However, the co-operation process has not gone as smoothly as our group members have expected, which could be a good lesson for future group projects. First and foremost, numbers of unsuccessful meeting attempts leading to lack of communications; then, we have members who left the course during the writing process, creating an unexpected challenge for the rest of our group to complete the assignment in full. Other than that, some sections have been hit with slow progress and missing contents that have been rendered some sections incomplete until the last minute.

                            We were able to manage and organise our group in such a way that everyone had an equal amount of workload to complete, and we prioritised our work accordingly so that everyone in the group could completed their share of work before deadline. We made sure that certain aspects of assignments were completed before certain dates so that we had ample time to fix any errors or issues before the due time.

                            <br />
                            One thing that our group can improve upon is attending group meeting more often and communicating more often with our teammates. There were times where we had difficulty in conducting our meetings at the pre-planned time as some members were occupied with their work or were not at a place where they could appropriately join the meeting. Therefore, meetings had to be cancelled or postponed. This had a negative impact on the assignment and the timely preparation of it. Improving on that would mean that any work which hasn’t been completed by any of the team members can be completed timely, and so we don’t have to rush in any way before the deadline and submit our work in good quality.

                            A major surprise and a major setback on the group was when a member of the group withdrew from the course with only two days left for the assignment submission. He did send us his part; however, it lacked a lot of required information and contributed to added pressure on the team.

                            One thing we learnt was that every member of the group is dedicated, smart and has their own strengths. Each member of the group contributed the required amount of work and in fact more than what was required to complete the assignment. This was despite of their busy work life or the unbelievable pandemic situation in India where two of our members are based in. We also learnt that working in groups is not as easy as you would think, as the situations that each of our members are in varied a lot.

                            Our GitHub logs does not represent how well our group performed on the assignment as we divided work equally with everyone. Our group decided that only one person will work on website and each of the other individuals will work on their part of assignment. This was done as that one person was highly knowledgeable in HTML site development. Instead of GitHub the minutes of the formal group meetings, messages and even informal group meeting on teams clearly represent how well the group worked on the assignment.
