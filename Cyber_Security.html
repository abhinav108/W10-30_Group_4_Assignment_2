                            Collection of computer networks interconnected with each other, generally termed as the Internet has revolutionized globally and have made a big impact on human lives. The Internet is decentralized which means that anyone can contribute and share information and so applications like websites and apps are hosted publically on servers. Attacks on these publically accessible servers and computer networks could prove disastrous outcomes. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The term is used in a variety of contexts, ranging from business to mobile computing, and it can be broken down into a few categories: 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Network security</b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It is the security guidelines and practices to prevent and reveal unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. There are two types of network threats, namely, Passive Network Threats and Active Network Threats. Passive threats in Information security are an attempt to gain information about the target without changing the data whereas Active threats in Information security are an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the computer network either to alter system resources or affect the performance of the computer system (Kaspersky 2021). Denial of service (DoS) attack is considered as one of the most concerning cyber threats of all time.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Application security </b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It increases the security of apps by detecting and correcting code flaws. If the application is hacked, it may allow access to data that was supposed to be safe and secure. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Information security or data security</b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It protects data from unauthorised access or modifications both when it is stored and when it is transferred from one machine to another.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Operational security (OPSEC)</b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In this process companies gain and secure people’s information regarding themselves.It is an analyzing process where data assets analyzed and find out what is necessary to control these data assets
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Our world has been fully transformed as a result of the digital conversion. Without a doubt, technology is beneficial to the economy, but it also presents us with new security challenges. A large number of government and private entities were subjected to security threats. 
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            As a result, it safeguards our sensitive data from cyber-attacks. It offers comprehensive digital protection to the entire organization in terms of business security. This improves the user's internet browsing experience without any risks from potential threats. Furthermore, in this digital age of the new world, personal data or information is one of the most valuable assets.Through its end-to-end encryption, it also protects our sensitive information. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            It can also have an impact on a company's productivity. For example, viruses and malware can significantly slow down an organization's processes, making it difficult for workers to function efficiently. As a result of this, the organisation could lose money and valuable time.  
 <br />
                            <br />
                            The significant growth of the Cyber Security industry is far from its high level with the next ten years promising to introduce a whole new book of terminology and technologies(O'Hara 2021). As more and more individuals trust the Internet with their personal information and data, hackers are gaining opportunities like never before to steal and sell this data. Careers in Cyber Security promise to become even more challenging in response. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            With the birth of the internet, the number of targets that cyber criminals can go for has increased exponentially. Meanwhile, the tools available to detect and defend against these attacks would be enhanced. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            The cloud technology puts a huge impact on the world of cyber security. Cloud technology is welcomed by several business and government agencies day by day to store their vital information. Features like virtualized firewall, digital intrusion detection system and prevention system will be used from cloud. The drawbacks of using usernames and passwords are popular nowadays and there is a requirement of more advanced and secure forms of authentication for example intel is now introducing a technology where different types of hardware factors will be combined and check the user’s identity. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It has a positive effect not only on industry but also on other fields. As many businesses conduct business via the internet, an e-commerce website, for example, plays a critical role in any business's ability to handle and increase revenue if the website hosting system is infected by a cyber attack. As a result, the only alternative will be to shut down the website. It will ensure that your website does not go down. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            There are a number of things that need to change firstly personal information of a company should be kept confidential. Potential workers and customers aren't required to know the organization's owner's personal information.In addition to that because of an individual’s mistake the whole team can suffer vast problems. So each and every employee should use strong passwords for their email id.Employee should have the ability to find the difference between fraud and official emails. As various companies upload their data on cloud trustworthy. So cyber security features need to be more advanced and secured using updated encryptions and algorithms. People encrypted their data after that they can upload on cloud systems. Hence it can enhance the security of information uploaded on the cloud. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            Medical services, retailers and public entities  face these issues mostly. These organizations get attacked by cyber criminals in act to collect financial data. As most of  companies have connected their bank account to their platforms. Government across the globe have responded to the increasing cyber attacks with guidance to aid companies implement effective cyber security practices. There are different tricks used by cyber criminals to target their victims or in other words there different types of cyber security threats 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Malware-</b> It is a malicious software created and transferred by criminals to the target's system. It is one of the most common cyber threats. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Trojans-</b> It is similar to malware which is tricked by hackers. Initially these Trojans look like simple software but after some time they cause damage to the system's data. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Phishing-</b> It is a process to target victims sensitive information like user id and password through email by creating a fake login page. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            Cyber security jobs are in high demand and it doesn’t seem like the need for more security professionals is going anywhere in the foreseeable future (Dsouza 2021). Cyber threats are just becoming more common and more dangerous  and even though we tend to only hear about the attacks of high profile entities. Computer Science roles are already in high demands as these cyber-attacks making these roles even more critical and sought after. AI technology has started to replace humans in various fields. However, that doesn’t seem to be in the case cyber security. While automatic features of machines sometimes mitigate operational errors and make it easier to manage tasks, using AI to spot cyber attacks isn’t completely practical or possible because such systems yield a large number of false positives. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It safeguards my personal information and data stored in the cloud from unauthorised access. Since many students are victims of phishing attacks, it will help me distinguish between official and fake login forms and emails. Cyber security would improve the security of my device and remove the possibility of it being compromised. As a result, system freezes and crashes will be reduced, saving me time and effort. It recognises the flaws and vulnerable entities that could help an attacker in gaining access to the device or server.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            It also protects the system against spyware, viruses, malicious codes, Trojan horses, worms, and other malware. It will not only protect the data I've uploaded to Google Drive, but also my bank account information. Apart from that, I need to be constantly aware of any cyber threat and change some of my regular activities, such as using strong passwords, recognising phishing emails, and browsing the internet safely. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            My friends, like me, trust the internet, so using cyber security to keep details private on the internet would be extremely beneficial. In the case of my family, there will be different situations. Although some of our senior citizens, such as grandfather and grandmother, are now familiar with new technology due to this new generation, they are still unaware of cyber threats, so cyber security would offer enormous protection to the entire family's networks from cybercrimes.
