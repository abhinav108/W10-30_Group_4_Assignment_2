                            As the popular adage goes “change is inevitable”. In this exciting generation, robots are evolving at a rapid pace aiming to improve, enhance and assist in our daily lives. According to Robotics Industry Association (RIA), robots are defined as a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motion for a variety of tasks (Robotics 2021). With this, robots carry substantial advantages in the work environment as opposed to humans. Three major examples being high productivity, saving workers from doing dangerous tasks and requiring less time to manufacture a greater quantity and quality of products due to its high accuracy. This is illustrated with the new contemporary robots that are currently being used to do the jobs which were dangerous, dirty or boring. The first commercially successful robotic vacuum produced was from iRobot in 2005 named “Roomba”. Roomba uses its piezoelectric sensor to detect the presence of excessive dirt and debris and triggers a built-in program to move to the desired area and perform a thorough cleaning while avoiding any obstacles in its way. Secondly, “Flippy” the burger grilling and flipping robot is currently growing rapidly in fast food restaurants. Flippy prime tasks are to pull raw patties from a stack and placing them on the grill, tracking each burger’s cook time and temperature, and transferring cooked burgers to a plate. Miso robotics is the company that designed Flippy and mentions that this robot is only commercially possible as a result of the cost of hardware experiencing a sudden decrease. Some of the latest additional features of Flippy involve the internal sensors which permit a safer work environment for employees and the ability to switch tools with the new AI system in place. The Compound Annual Growth Rate of the robotics industry is expected to be 22.6% from 2020-2025, increasing competition and innovation which will drive these modern technologies forward. (Markets and Markets 2020)  
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            As a result of the significant impact of the robot’s industry, the safety would increase and costs would reduce as the industry would expand and provide more options. It might seem to be science fiction to imagine a world where robotic devices are commonplace, but it is more plausible than one would believe. It is predicted that there is going to be a more consistent use of robotics in public security. For example, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport recently began experimenting with a new use case for robots that gives travellers tips on how to get through security faster (Port of Seattle 2021). The robot, which is stationed near screening areas, instructs passengers to remove their coats, shoes, and laptops from their luggage, among other things. This time-consuming task that TSA agents would otherwise undertake can now be delegated. Furthermore, this technology will change society in a very important way: it will allow law enforcement officials to act quickly whenever a suspicious behaviour has been spotted. This development is made possible as automatic recognition of suspicious activity is already a reality for camera-based security systems. Additionally, an increasing number of engineers’ haven taken inspiration from autonomous vehicles and are attempting to create an independent walking robotic exoskeleton to assist people in walking (Stampacchia, G. et al. 2016). Using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology, robotics researchers are designing exoskeletons and prosthetic legs that can think and make control decisions on their own. Researchers had initially planned to combat the switching of locomotion such as sitting from standing without using manual control as it may be mentally tiring, by inserting sensors to the legs that can detect bioelectric signals sent from your brain to your muscles telling them to move. However, this method was deemed unresponsive as challenging factors such as sweat would affect the skin’s conductivity. Hence, producing inconsistent results. Right now, many research groups are experimenting with a novel approach: equipping exoskeleton users with wearable cameras to provide vision data to the robots, allowing them to function autonomously. Artificial intelligence (AI) apps may use this information to identify stairwells, doors, and other aspects of the space and determine the best course of action. Ultimately, the most impressive feature to this invention is the efforts to improve the energy efficiency of motors for robotic exoskeletons and prostheses by using human motion to self-charge the batteries.

                            <br />
                            Some of the potential impacts of the usage of robotics in security involves it being cost effective. Robots are powered by batteries and will operate for as long as the batteries last. As a result, they can work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without taking a break for lunch or a bathroom break. As long as their batteries are charged, they can achieve a 100% concentration level. Furthermore, the Robotics' operating expenses are typically lower than the earnings of an equal worker, which makes practical sense for businesses looking to save money. With the implementation of robots, it is almost incorruptible. As a result, unlike other security personnel, they are not greedy and cannot be bribed. This could ensure the end of any form of bribes and cause a huge change in countries such as India where corruption is frequent. Many assume that robots in security would replace human security. However, that is not entirely true. In fact, human guarding and security robots work hand in hand. For instance, the limitation of robots includes the lack of flexibility where they are unable to carry out a new task as it is only able to carry out the task it was designed for (Vincent 2019).  This is where human security guards intervene and perform the tasks as it has the capability to think and perform the appropriate action based on their SOP. Conclusively, robotics in security may reduce the number of jobs but can only run with human observance. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Making headway, the robotic exoskeleton is represented mainly as alternatives to conventional mobility-oriented assistive devices which can offer additional options than wheelchairs and crutches, such as walking, climbing, and touching (Gorgey 2018). With this invention, individuals who have suffered permanent severe injuries and are unable to make movements can now be treated and regain control which would allow them to coordinate their movements from a remote control or even their mind. They also may be used as temporary recovery devices to assist physical therapy in assisting an individual in regaining complete or proper body movement function. The rehabilitation industry would benefit the most from this invention with new methods to engage the user’s sense of touch and movement by having training and understanding the muscle usage and strain. This would also provide new and more job opportunities in the rehabilitation field to further comprehend the usage of these machines and having subtle updates over time. 
 <br />
                            <br />
                            In my opinion, the introduction of robots in security would subconsciously ease my mind as I would feel more safer knowing the environment, I am in is continuously being monitored for suspicious behaviour. For instance, I would be more willing to expand my travelling scope to many various places which may have not been safe without robots. As a result, more travel companies will prosper, and tourism in places previously thought to be dangerous would have a more optimistic image. Moreover, when robotic security becomes more commercial, I would be more inclined to allow my family to be left home alone as I can be reassured knowing that the robot is more than capable of alerting the police or ambulance if needed. Thus, this would take the security industry by storm and is predicted to reduce the robberies and thefts by a huge margin.

                            <br />
                            Moving along, the robotic exoskeleton serves no direct benefit to me as I am quite able to carry out tasks freely. However, it does provide me with the option to avoid using my car and instead use the invention which would save me money and reduce pollution while not tiring me. This invention would be essential for my friends and family who have suffered from accidents and are going through rehabilitation. Furthermore, this invention provides the opportunity for people who never imagined they could ever walk again. However, Laschowski from Exonet adds, “User safety is of the utmost importance, especially considering that we're working with individuals with mobility impairments," resulting perhaps from advanced age or physical disabilities. “The exoskeleton user will always have the ability to override the system should the classification algorithm or controller make a wrong decision” (Choi 2021). Taking all this into consideration, I believe that the possibilities of a robotic exoskeleton is endless and would be implemented in the foreseeable future sooner rather than later.
