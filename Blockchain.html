                            Basically, Blockchain seems complicated, and it definitely can be, but its core concept is really quite simple.  Blockchain is a type of database. What is a database-lets understand that first? A collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system is a database. Data, or information in database is typically structured in table format to allow for easier searching and filtering for specific information. The main difference between a typical database and a blockchain is the way the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, also known as blocks, that hold sets of information, Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled they are chained onto the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the “blockchain”. All new information that follows that freshly added block is complied into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled. Data is structured into tables in a database whereas a Blockchain structures its data into chunks[blocks] that are chained together.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The way blockchain is implemented by cryptocurrency helps understanding Blockchain. Cryptocurrency needs a collection of computers to store its blockchain. For cryptocurrency, this blockchain is just a specific type of database that stores every transaction ever made. And unlike most databases, these computers are not all under one roof, and each computer or group of computers is operated by a unique individual or group of individuals. In blockchain, each node has a full record of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception. As For cryptocurrency, the data is the entire history of all transactions. If one node has an error in its data, it can use the thousands of other nodes as a reference point to correct itself. This way, no node within the network can alter information held within it, because of this the history of transactions in each block that make up Cryptocurrency blockchain is irreversible. If one user tampers with cryptocurrency record of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. For cryptocurrency, this information is a list of transactions, but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory.

                            <br />
                            Blockchain is the term used for the record-keeping technology behind the Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrency. It differs from the typical database in the way it stores information. Blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The most common use so far of blockchain has been storing information as a ledger for transactions though different types of information can be stored on a blockchain.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In case of Cryptocurrency, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control rather, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For cryptocurrency, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Blockchain technology works with the goal to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. Blockchain technology was developed with an intention to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. The launch of Cryptocurrency made the first real-world application of blockchain possible. Cryptocurrency is “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party” in words of Satoshi Nakamoto creator of Bitcoins.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Blockchain could be used in a variety of industries and fields in the coming times. Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever, and a host of others. IBM has created its food trust blockchain 1 to trace the journey that food products take to get to its locations. Using blockchains gives brands the ability to track a food products route from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally its delivery, if a food is found to be contaminated then it can be traced all the way back through each stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner, potentially saving lives, this is one example of blockchain in practice, but there are many other forms of blockchain implementation.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Blockchains can be used in voting system, Banking and finance, Currency healthcare. Records of property, smart contracts. Surely, Blockchain technology will surely replace some technologies and impact current job market. Blockchain is comfortably settling and has seen its fair share of public scrutiny over the last two decades, with business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap with fewer middlemen. AS of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and with many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored. Blockchain is finally making a name for itself. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The development, acceptance, and usage of blockchain technology is increasing with every coming day. We may soon be seeing cryptocurrencies secured by blockchain, coming at par with or even replacing the regular currencies for everyday transactions. It would make thing more secure and transparent and allow people to have a complete tab on their data without actually worrying about it getting hacked or tampered with as well as providing personal privacy and individual control over user information.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The increased rise of technology has by far surpassed the capacity of regulators to keep up, resulting in products and platforms that invade our privacy and threaten our rights to free speech. Blockchain promises to disrupt invasive social platforms that censor out content and mine and sell our personal data, by providing secure and private decentralized social networks that put the users in control.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It will make travel and hospitality easier. As travel is often fraught with inconveniences, from long lines to lost luggage. Blockchain is now being used to reduce booking errors, securely store frequent traveller information, and more.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Blockchain will help secure my Intellectual and creative properties. Blockchain uses cases for IP include Registration, Distribution tracking, Real-time payment transmission authentication, retrieval of stolen goods.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In a way it will not only impact me but my friends as well as family in one way or other. Blockchain has great potential for improving our lives in the near and distant future.
